When to use borrowed strings vs String class in rust?


In general, if you need to pass a string around without modifying it, or 
if the string's lifetime is shorter than the function that uses it, 
use a borrowed string (&str). If you need to manipulate the string or 
modify it over time, use a String. It's also worth noting that some 
APIs might only accept one type or the other, so you might need to use 
a particular type based on the requirements of the API you're interacting 
with.
